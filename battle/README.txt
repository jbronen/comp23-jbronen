1. I believe everything is correctly implemented, but I'm not sure about the
   sidescrolling feel.
2. I discussed the assignment with Jessie Chapman, but we didn't not share any
   actual algorithms for our code. I also used examples and other .py files
   from the GameDevelopment folder provided for us by the course.
3. I spent approximately 8 hours on this assignment.
