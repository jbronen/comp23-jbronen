1. Lasers.py is correctly implemented, Battlecruiser.py is correctly implemented
   as well, but holding down keys to move does not work.
2. I took Laser-groups.py from the examples in the github repository.
   I changed it to match the specifications of the assignment.
3. I spent approximately 5 hours on this assignment.
